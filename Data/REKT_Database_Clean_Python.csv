0,Terra Classic,"A complex mixture of events and market dynamics cost the implosion of the $40b Terra (Classic) Network. Details of the ExploitThe Terra Luna Network was focused on its two native coins $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC was the algorithmic Stablecoin that was supposed to hold the peg to 1$ and $LUNC functioned as the satellite asset that absorbed $USTC’s volatility. This was achieved through a mint and burn functionality as well as by arbitrage which the former function inherently enabled.$USTC rose to prominence in rapid fashion even surpassing $DAI in market cap. The Luna Foundation Group decided to start a new Curve4pool with $FRAX, $USTC, $USDC and $USDT as assets, excluding $DAI in an attempt to starve the most used StableCoin pool used by institutions the Curve3pool on the Ethereum network.The migration of $USTC from the Curve3pool is the event that started the bankrun. In early May, the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew 250 million $USTC from the Curve3pool in preparation for the Curve4pool. Simultaneously, a handful of whales withdrew sizeable amounts from the anchor protocol, a crypto savings bank. The biggest wallet withdrew 347 million $USTC in total and bridged funds to the Curve3pool in order to swap for other assets. This movement of funds created an imbalance between $USTC and other Stablecoins in the pool, resulting in devaluation of $USTC on exchanges.As a result of the tokenomics of $USTC and $LUNC the firesale of $USTC resulted in uncontrollable minting of the $LUNC token and a rapid fall in valuation. Additionally, the Terra network went down due to overload in transaction as market participants were panicking and trying to answer margin calls within the Anchor protocol. Eventually massive liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol would be incurred by investors.Block Data ReferenceWhale Addresses:https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0ahttps://etherscan.io/address/0x4b5e60cb1cd6c5e67af5e6cf63229d1614bb781chttps://etherscan.io/address/0x1df8ea15bb725e110118f031e8e71b91abaa2a06https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb5425e650b04e49e5e8b62fbf1c3f60df01f232https://etherscan.io/address/0x41339d9825963515e5705df8d3b0ea98105ebb1chttps://etherscan.io/address/0x68963dc7c28a36fcacb0b39ac2d807b0329b9c69https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f705ff1da72ed334f0e80f90aae5644f5cd7784",Stablecoin,"LUNC, USTC",2022-05-08,40000000000.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",['Terra Classic'],5.0,6.0,128.0

The initial attack appears to have taken place with this transaction, where 100 (WBTC) were extracted from the protocol; https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61497a1a8a8659a06358e130ea590e1eed8956edbd99dbb2048cfb46850a8f17. This hack was made possible by an operational error incurred by the team, which had been found and commented upon in an audit report made by Quantstamp. Essentially, at the initialization of the contract the ""process()"" function checks messages for an acceptable merkle root. The team accidentally marked the zero root (0x00) as acceptable. This error enabled every message to be auto-proven by default. Essentially, the attacker was able to process transactions without any proving by calling the function ""process()"".This information spread within the community and all that was needed to participate in the looting of the protocol was finding a transaction that worked and copy-pasting the transaction with the wallet of desire at the receiving end. This is the reason why tokens were predominantly extracted in the exact same denomination.The initial attack was followed by hundreds of EOA`s extracting assets such as $WBTC, $FXS, $C3, $DAI, $USDC from the bridge. Amongst the looters were reputable hackers from other exploits such as the Rari Capital Exploiter as well as White hat hackers who intend to return the funds.As the time of this writing approx. $32 million have been returned to the Nomad Recovery Funds Address https://etherscan.io/address/0x94A84433101A10aEda762968f6995c574D1bF154 by white hat hackers and cooperating culprits.Block Data ReferenceAttacker address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x56d8b635a7c88fd1104d23d632af40c1c3aac4e3Attacker contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf57113d8f6ff35747737f026fe0b37d4d7f42777Attack transactions: 1) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x61497a1a8a8659a06358e130ea590e1eed8956edbd99dbb2048cfb46850a8f172) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x29b67e0701ddd910ff6a069aa039015eb78b1ee6d99ad8da5d0ef63916f3fd573) https://etherscan.io/tx/0xdf6bef0d8dee8b44863ac61092a711b877dcfe3d61da93d7289e0c6285af1b454) https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3dbed4a1ebb2289273370ce0ef10302882927abe946299cf2ca3073f1a3dcdd9Nomad Recovery Funds Address:https://etherscan.io/address/0x94A84433101A10aEda762968f6995c574D1bF154",Bridge,Nomad: ERC20 Bridge,2022-08-01,190000000.0,36342325.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",['Ethereum'],8.0,0.0,213.0

After, he generated the token BEAN3CRV-f using BEANS. This was followed by a deposit of 32 million $BEAN tokens and 25 million $LUSD into yet another contract to create a new token named BEAN3LUSD-f.BEAN3CRV-f and BEAN3LUSD-f may be transformed straight into Seeds (a special type of asset called which acts like voting power in the system), providing the attacker with sufficient voting power.

The attacker used two addresses to pump the $MNGO price and used the tokens to take a loan of 116,000,000 $USD from various pools. From the first address, the attacker bought $MNGO tokens for 5,000,000 $USDC and created opened position. From the second address, the same amount of the tokens have been bought and a long position opened for hedging purposes. Consequently, the attacker was able to pump the token price due to little liquidity in the pool. After the accident, the exploiter opened a proposal on MangoDAO for returning the user's deposit funds for immunity, turning Mango users against the DEX.

Maiar DEX was successfully recovered by the Elrond team, and user funds were not affectedDetails of the ExploitThe Maiar DEX protocol was attacked by hackers who took advantage of a vulnerability in the WEGLD contract to steal funds from the protocol on the Elrond network.

The most important here is the wrat_egls_callback() function. This function enables the wrapping and unwrapping of the $EGLD token.In the transaction below, it can be noticed that as the new smart contract sends a small amount of $EGLD to the wrapEgId() method and this method sends $WEDLD to the wrap_edId_callback() method of the new contract:https://explorer.elrond.com/transactions/848b5a96bd95d3537f2bb8cfc5c1ebc5ec580e72214dd75c85be718ae0bbf3fb#4159433916247dbdbfbbf31d8a4cc8ce14a3a86e5a5f7beb1cddcf5abc59b83eDeploying the wrap_egId_callback() method, was found a call of the managedExecuteOnDestContextByCaller() method, which allows attacker to ""ask"" the victim's contract to send funds to any other address that the attacker indicates, which happened during the attack on Maiar DEX. The Elrond team paused the work of Maiar DEX, they also froze stablecoins so that the hacker would not be able to withdraw funds through the bridge to another network. Having connections with other major exchanges, they handed over a blacklist with addresses so that the fraudster would not be able to withdraw funds. The executeOnDestContextByCaller() function was removed to avoid a repeat attack.

40,Horizon by Harmony,"Harmony's Horizon Bridge was exploited by an attacker resulting in losses of roughly $100M. The bridge was secured by multisig wallet which needed 2 out of 5 wallets to confirm transaction. The hacker gained control over 2 wallets which enabled the attacker to drain the funds of the bridge and transfer said funds to his wallet.Details of the Exploit For yet unspecified reasons the attacker gained access over 2 of the 5 multisig wallets.The attacker was able to enter and confirm transactions by himself. The exploit resulted in the loss of: ETH, USDC, WBTC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, AAG, FXS, SUSHI, AAVE, WETH, and FRAX. The ONE token was not affected by this attack.For more context, bridges in DeFi are used to enable interoperability between blockchains. Through bridges a user of DeFi may pursue opportunities in an ecosystem that is not native to the coins or tokens a user is holding. For example through Harmony's Horizon Bridge a user holding $ETH on the Ethereum network could bridge $ETH over to the Harmony blockchain receiving newly minted wrapped $1ETH on a 1:1 ratio. Since the funds on the bridge were seized by the attacker, the receipt was no longer backed by the collateral on a 1:1 ratio. The depreciation of the wrapped assets were felt by users in the form of massive slippages on dexes and other bridges as users tried to flee the Harmony Ecosystem.Below a breakdown of the specific function used by the attacker.1) The multisig owner called the submitTransaction(), then to confirm owner calls confirmTransaction() from the MultiSigWallet with the input transactionId 21106.2) The executeTransaction() function has made an external call with input that will call the unlockEth() function in the Ethmanager contract.

The lock contract would then generate a position ID which was used in order to release the users funds if desired.The attacker initially deposited 100,000 UST to the lock contract in this transaction:https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/29C9CFBBC9562100A5DB19D705E440CE24768D3BDE399507FA1C2EC2424413C4 in order to prepare the attack.The attacker noticed that the lock contract had a vulnerability which allowed the attacker to unlock funds by using the same position ID over and over again as can be seen in this transaction: https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/08DD2B70F6C2335D966342C20C1E495FD7A8872310B80BAF3450B942F79EBC1F, exploiting the protocol for approx. $90 million USTC in the process.Block Data ReferenceAttacker address: https://finder.terra.money/mainnet/address/terra1200zm8crgjaj949ta8r7p6pay0qq638js4sdmh","Other,Borrowing and Lending",MIR,2021-10-08,90000000.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",['Terra Classic'],10.0,4.0,281.0

The protocol confirmed a hack on Twitter, 206,809 $BNB was stolen which was worth 80,000,000 $USD up to that time. The attack flow is below:The attacker:- funded his wallet with 0.8887725 ETH from Tornado Cash- sent 16 deposit transactions to QBridge of Ethereum- sent 16 voteProposal transactions to QBridge contract of BSC by Qubit Relayer - a number of $xETH tokens were minted by 16 voteProposal transactions, and liquidity in Qubit was withdrawn using this as collateral.The attacker called the QBridge deposit function on the Ethereum network, which calls the deposit function QBridgeHandler. QBridgeHandler should receive the $WETH token, which is the original tokenAddress, and if the person who performed the tx does not have a $WETH token, the transfer should not occur.tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom(depositer, address(this), amount);In the deposit function above, tokenAddress is 0, so safeTransferFrom didn’t fail and the deposit function ended normally regardless of the amount value. Additionally, tokenAddress was the $WETH address before depositETH was added, but as depositETH is added, it is replaced with the zero address that is the tokenAddress of ETH.In summary, the deposit function was a function that should not be used after depositETH was newly developed, but it remained in the contract, which allows the attacker to use this to steal the funds.Block Data ReferenceAttacker address:https://etherscan.io/address/0xD01Ae1A708614948B2B5e0B7AB5be6AFA01325c7",Borrowing and Lending,,2022-01-27,80000000.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",['Binance'],1.0,3.0,27.0

As a consequence, the hacker was able to deploy a bogus contract that was never verified, followed by a chain of bogus accounts that all passed validation since they were only compared to one another.In addition, in order to pass the common collateral verification, the hacker created a fake bank and was able to instruct the program to mint the original $CASH token because there was no check that the bank's token matched the one being minted.After these actions, the hacker minted 2 billion $CASH tokens, and the part of $CASH was burnt to SaberLPTokens. Then another part of the tokens was withdrawn out to $UST and $USDC. The remaining $CASH was swapped for 8,600,000 $UST and 17,000,000 $USDC.

72,Cream Finance,"Cream Finance got exploited through a vulnerability hidden in the borrow() function, which was repeatedly utilized for reentrancy attacks. The attacker made away with approx. $36 million.Details of the ExploitCream (Crypto Rules Everything Around Me) Finance is a decentralized lending protocol designed for institutions, protocols and people in order to access financial services.The risk for reentrancy arose because of the way $AMP was integrated into the protocol. The $AMP token contract is based on the ERC777 standard, which utilizes the _callPostTransferHooks hook. The attack transactions started with supplying $ETH as a collateral for borrowing $AMP from the crAMP market.

However, in the second supply(), the attacker not only supplied 0.00000001 imBTC but also withdraw() 290 imBTC within the hook by hijacking the transferFrom() function within doTransferIn(). As a consequence, 290 imBTC were deducted from the attacker's balance under the integrated withdraw(). When the execution returned to supply(), however, the balance was reset to 290 imBTC.

118,Inverse Finance (1),"Inverse Finance has been exploited for ~$14.5M worth of asset loss. The reason for the attack was the price manipulation of ‘external price oracle'. The attacker purchased INV tokens, and with the help of price manipulation overestimated the price of it, which allowed the attacker to borrow 1588 ETH, 94 WBTC, 3999669 DOLA and 39 YFI, which significantly exceeded their initial INV investment.Attack step by step:1) Attacker deployed malicious smart-contract at this address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xea0c959bbb7476ddd6cd4204bdee82b790aa1562, and swapped INV/XINV using SushiSswap and Curve.fi to manipulate price: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x20a6dcff06a791a7f8be9f423053ce8caee3f9eecc31df32445fc98d4ccd83652) Due to the small liquidity of SushiSwap on the INV/ETH pair, the exchange for 300 ETH was enough to change the price of the INV token.3) Then the attacker deposits the funds in INV received at the preparation stage and mints 1746 XINV tokens. The XINV price is calculated of INV from SushiSwap INV/ETH pair.4) With the rise in the price of XINV, the attacker was able to borrow assets using minted XINV tokens.Exploiter addresses: 1) https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b4c1083cd6aef062298e1fa900df9832c8351b32) https://etherscan.io/address/0x117c0391b3483e32aa665b5ecb2cc539669ea7e9Exploiter contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0xea0c959bbb7476ddd6cd4204bdee82b790aa1562",Borrowing and Lending,INV,2022-04-02,14500000.0,0.0,"{'id': 17, 'type': 'Oracle Issue'}",['Ethereum'],4.0,5.0,92.0

It turned out that the account robbed was managed through Gatehub.net, and that the offending account (r9do2Ar8k64NxgLD6oJoywaxQhUS57Ck8k) had stolen substantial amounts from several other XRP accounts, likely to be or have been managed through Gatehub.net.”Silkjær stated that as of June 5, approximately 23,200,000 XRP (nearly $9.5 million at press time) were stolen from 80–90 victims, of which around 13,100,000 XRP ($5.37 million) had already been laundered through exchanges and mixer services.",,,2019-06-06,10000000.0,0.0,"{'id': 9, 'type': 'Access Сontrol'}",['Other'],6.0,3.0,157.0

Gox's user database leaked for sale to pastebin, signed by ~cRazIeStinGeR~ and tied to auto36299386@hushmail.com. The theft of Bitcoins from Mt. Gox accounts continued, reportedly, throughout that day.On 19 June, a stream of fraudulent trades caused the nominal price of a bitcoin to fraudulently drop to one cent on the Mt. Gox exchange after a hacker allegedly used credentials from a Mt. Gox auditor's compromised computer to transfer a large number of bitcoins illegally to himself. He used the exchange's software to sell them all nominally, creating a massive ""ask"" order at any price. Within minutes the price corrected to its correct user-traded value. Accounts with the equivalent of more than $8,750,000 were affected. To prove that Mt. Gox still had control of the coins, the move of 424,242 bitcoins from ""cold storage"" to Mt.

176,Squid Game," The Squid game project has been rug pulled by its team by way of blacklisting users from selling the $SQUID token. Investors were collectively alleviated of approx. $ 5,7 million.Details of the Exploit The Squid game project was inspired by the hit Netflix show and promised to be a play to earn game, hereby resembling the actions in the series. The hype surrounding the Netflix show combined with the increased interest in crypto due to the bull market incentivized big news outlets such as BBC and CNBC to write about the rapid surge in price of the new $SQUID token. Retailers around the world pushed the price from $0,01 to $2,861 in little over a week. CoinMarketCap published a warning concerning this project from the start as early investors reported that the sell of the token on pancake swap was not possible. A look at the smart contract revealed that all 3 contracts: SQUID, Marbles, and MasterChef were upgradable. Meaning the contract deployer would change the mechanisms of the project at will.For example a new MasterChef made it possible for the 0x71 EOA to withdraw all tokens from the MasterChef contract at the following transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf7c9d0e5a81999f9e06fe78df7ce41da112d8bd4f2da7b16cfdbbe46c92cb6afThe Squid game project boasted two token. The $Marbels token was required in order to be eligible to sell $SQUID on the open market. $Marbles were not tradable on the market and could only be obtained by participating in the game with an entrance fee of $SQUID 456. Meaning at the all time high price of the SQUID token a withdrawal would have costed at least $1,3 million.The contract deployer also blacklisted all users that did not hold Marble's token to prevent from selling SQUID in this transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5b82e96fccaa9ccc3255b509df51d127aa7ad402624f07683855d0e1c4555041Block Data ReferenceInvolved EOA addresses:https://bscscan.com/address/0x71d934aa2119ca3995f702f075d540f7a6b0f728https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aahttps://bscscan.com/address/0x1f5eabba9c56bca4a7828969b79bc87051125b31https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb650x32 invoked the internal protocol's contract which worked as the interface of the PancakeSwap pair contract to sell SQUID tokens at multiple transactions under the ""0x5c2a8729"" method:https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb65Example of ""0x5c2a8729"" transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x98a07fde52914566a72b7eeb2ec1b1af3cb9a0a1d817bb1fb8d6d204993ae96aThe WBNB recipient was EOA, marked as SQUID Token Rug 2, which then deposited stolen funds into Tornado Cash Proxy:https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aa2 unverified smart contracts were used to sell SQUID tokens:https://bscscan.com/address/0x95eb532f23a97191324103755332a3dff97d722fhttps://bscscan.com/address/0x5b871670d4f1d81591ecf641588a28f5032c9dcd",Gaming / Metaverse,"SQUID, Marbles",2021-11-01,5723268.0,0.0,"{'id': 10, 'type': 'Rugpull'}",['Binance'],11.0,0.0,305.0

Slope Wallet developers used Sentry to transfer data to the network. By default, Sentry does not use 2FA from which it can be concluded that most likely the Sentry Slope account was compromised, and since the data storage period in Sentry is 90 days, and it is possible to track the data of users who created their accounts in this period of time, the hacker gained access to the clean data of users' wallets such as mnemonic and private key.

This rate attracted many investors, and Pirate claimed that over 500,000 bitcoins had been deposited.After accumulating an ever-larger amount of bitcoin, transactions were becoming difficult and expensive. Pirate attempted to reduce the strain by lowering the interest rate, but this sparked unrest and mass withdrawals. After a discussion with his clients, Pirate decided to close BST and announced his intentions to return all owned bitcoins.

This allowed the exploit contract to use those LP tokens as collateral for borrowing crypto assets from Cheese Bank- raised the CHEESE price at UniswapV2 by swapping 20k ETH to 288k CHEESE, making the UNI_V2 LP tokens more valuable as collaterals Cheese Bank. This is the crucial step in this incident since the Cheese Bank uses the amount of WETH in a liquidity pool to estimate the price of the corresponding LP token. The manipulated UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH pool (with 20k+ WETH) allowed the attacker to drain all the USDC, USDT, and DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by legit borrow() calls- refreshed the price feeds of Cheese Bank. The attacker intentionally invoked the CheesePriceOracle::refresh() function to refresh the price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token which is derived from the amount of WETH in the liquidity pool and the ETH price derived from the UNI_V2-USDT-ETH pool. Specifically, the CheesePriceOracle::fetchLPAnhorPrice() function gets the wEthBalance of UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH contract. With the passed in ethPrice, the totalValue is derived by wEthBalance x 2 x ethPrice. Therefore, the unit price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token is computed by totalValue / totalSupply of LP tokens. It means if the attacker could somehow increase the amount of WETH in a pool (e.g., addLiquidity() with flash loan ether), the price of the LP token would be increased- drained the USDC, USDT, DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by borrow() calls. Besides the 2M USDC, 1.23M USDT and 87k DAI are borrowed from Cheese Bank. The exact balance of USDC/USDT/DAI is borrowed by the exploit contract- swapped 288k CHEESE back to 19.98k ETH at UniswapV2- swapped 58k USDC to 132 ETH at UniswapV2- collected assets into https://etherscan.io/address/02b7165d0916e373f0235056a7e6fccdb82d2255- repaid 21k ETH flashloan to dYdX.",Borrowing and Lending,CHEESE,2020-11-06,3300000.0,0.0,"{'id': 15, 'type': 'Flash Loan Attack'}",['Ethereum'],11.0,4.0,311.0

It is noteworthy that the new Terra Network was launched within days after the collapse of the Terra Classic Network. The protocol suffered an exploit in the amount of $2 million caused by outdated oracle price feeds. The price feeds used the price of the new Luna Coin instead of the LunaC. While the new Luna coin was trading at a price around 5$ at the time, the $LUNAC coin was practically worthless at a price point of fractions of a cent.

This platform allows users to stake NFT tokens to receive fungible tokens e.g. $ETH. The attacker deposited NFTs from the collection Doodles that were used as a collateral to borrow $WETH. Then the attacker exploited a vulnerability in order to execute a reentrancy attack by withdrawing all NFTs deposited as collateral by the attacker except for one NFT. This action triggered a malicious callback function that allowed the attacker to buy more Doodles before  liquidating the loan position: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x05d65e0adddc5d9ccfe6cd65be4a7899ebcb6e5ec7a39787971bcc3d6ba73996When the position is liquidated, the remaining Doodle NFT from the collateral were returned to the attacker. The credit position is liquidated because NFT value from initial collateral is insufficient to cover the debt position. As the attacker is able to force through using the borrowed WETH to buy more NFTs before the liquidation occurs. As a result, the money received from the attack was withdrawn through Tornado.cash. Block Data ReferenceAttacker account address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x627a22ff70cb84e74c9c70e2d5b0b75af5a1dcb9Attacker contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5992f10a5b284be845947a1ae1694f8560a89fa8Contract creations transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x193016ce1ed6c7ec6377efd89309f7415c21190619b8e1fe625a6cdcca4f5ba5Exploited smart contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8","NFT,Borrowing and Lending",,2022-07-10,1430000.0,0.0,"{'id': 16, 'type': 'Reentrancy'}",['Ethereum'],7.0,6.0,191.0

330,OpenSea,"A bug has been exploited to purchase NFTs from users of OpenSea, at well below market value.Was identified at least five attackers who have exploited this loophole to purchase at least twelve NFTs for much less than their market value. These include Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Cool Cats, and Cyberkongz NFTs.The exploit:- when you list an item for sale (or bid) you are signing data that validate that you are willing to sell your NFT at this price- the signature is saved in OpenSea's DB off-chain and when someone wants to buy your NFT, they will send to their smart contract your previously signed data where the signature and sale information (such as expiration & price) are validated on-chain before making the transfer- when you cancel a listing, you are required to perform a transaction. The reason is that someone might save your signed listing (which are public - i.e https://orders.rarible.com or even their API) and use it later, even if the listing got removed from the UI- the transaction on-chain will save the fact that you canceled this sale on their smart contract and even if someone will try to use your signed data from before, the on-chain validation will reject the sale- the bug stems from the fact that previously you could re-list an NFT without canceling it and all the previous listings are not canceled on-chain, this is why re-listing will not workFor example, at around 7 am on January 24, a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT #9991 was purchased for 0.77 ETH ($1,800). This family of NFTs currently sells for at least $198,000. Twenty minutes later the hacker sold the NFT for 84.2 ETH ($196,000) – realizing a profit of $194,000.One attacker, going by the pseudonym ""jpegdegenlove"" paid a total of $133,000 for seven NFTs – before quickly selling them on for $934,000 in ether.

The first batch was sold for 540 ETH in KyberSwap that, after internal consulting of reserves, was routed the swap order to the KyberUniswap reserve (0x31e085afd48a1d6e51cc193153d625e8f0514c7f) and got 92,419 sUSD in return. The second batch was sold 18 times for 20 ETH each, also in Kyber that, after internal consulting of reserves, routed the swap orders to the Kyber-sUSD reserve (0x4cb01bd05e4652cbb9f312ae604f4549d2bf2c99) and got 63,584 sUSD in return. The sell-off of these two batches effectively drove the price of sUSD up to 0.00899 ETH (or 1ETH=111 sUSD). The manipulated price is around 2.5x higher when compared to the average ETH/sUSD market price. After the swap, the attacker acquired 92,419+63,584=156,003 sUSD tokens at his disposal- turned to Synthetic Depot contract to acquire substantially more sUSD at market price. Note Synthetic Depot contract allows for depositing Ether for sUSD at a fair rate. The attacker sent 6,000 ETH and bought 943,837 sUSD back (with 2,482 ETH refunded back as there’s no enough sUSD to buy). Note this step is typically launched before the previous step. For whatever reason, this is not the case in this particular hack (and the ordering does not affect the final result as the pricing in Synthetic Depot is not affected by KyberSwap)- the sUSD/ETH price was driven up and the attacker has >1M sUSD at his disposal. Note that the attacker takes the approach by capitalizing on the spiked price in a profitable Compound position in the first hack. Considering the possibly low liquidity of sUSD, the attacker this time takes the approach of first collateralizing the collected >1M sUSD back into bZx and then borrowing from it 6,796 ETH. As bZx relies on Kyber for the price feed, with the spiked sUSD/ETH price, the collection of >1M sUSD allows for the borrow of 6796 ETH. With the normal conversion rate of 1ETH=111 sUSD, the same amount of sUSD tokens can only buy 4,000 ETH, which indicates that this loan is now underwater with insufficient collateralization- the attacker repaid the 7,500 ETH flash loan back to bZx with a profit of 2,378 ETH",,BZRX,2020-02-18,665840.0,0.0,"{'id': 15, 'type': 'Flash Loan Attack'}",['Ethereum'],2.0,1.0,49.0

The attacker calculated the limit and swapped the maximum allowed amount of WETH for STA via a flurry of operations. The result of performing the above swaps is to intentionally left 1e-18 in the Balancer pool- by sending in 1e-18 STA into BPool via swapExactAmountIn(), the attacker swapped out 30,347 WETH in the first run. In internal records for book-keeping, _records[STA] is increased by tokenAmountIn (i.e., 1) before the BPool contract actually collects the corresponding STA tokens from the msg.sender- the _pullUnderlying() function collected the STA tokens. Note: STA is a deflationary token that charges shown 1% on every token transfer. Because of the transfer fee cut, the Balancer pool actually got zero STA tokens. Therefore, there’s a mismatch between the actual STA balance of BPool and its internal records (i.e., _records[STA])- The gulp() is exploited to reset the _records[STA], which helps the attacker to maintain the state that BPool has only 1e-18 STA- repaid the flash loan back to dYdX.",Exchange (DEX),BAL,2020-06-28,523613.0,0.0,"{'id': 15, 'type': 'Flash Loan Attack'}",['Ethereum'],6.0,6.0,180.0

Because the implementation interprets the same batch of ETH as many batches of ETH receptions, the hacker re-uses that batch of ETH to recover the collateral USDC and profit. Opyn allowed anyone to exercise a vault with underlying assets and oTokens. By burning the oTokens and taking in the underlying assets, the Option Contracts payout collateral assets to the caller of exercise().The Opyn ETH Put contract must take in the underlying assets and burn oTokens inside the _exercise() method before paying out collateral assets. The transferFrom() function is used to transfer assets from the msg.sender to address(this), which is a very typical approach. When the underlying asset is ETH, the treatment is completely different.

433,Cauldron,"The biggest flash loan attack on Avalanche in 2022 was detected. The attacker took 370,000 $USD after interacting with several assets.Details of the ExploitThe attacker interacted with Cauldron, Aave, JoeSwap, and Curve for various purposes. The attacker used a malicious smart contract with an unverified source code to withdraw 998,000 $nxUSD using LP tokens worth 500,000 $USDC. The full attack flow of the exploit transaction succeeded as follows:   1. The attackers malicious contract flashloaned 51,000,000 $USDC from Aave   2. 280,000 $USDC were swapped to $WAVAX with JoeSwap   3. liquidity was added using claimed $WAVAX and 260,000 $USDC so 0.0045 JoeLPToken was received   4. The remaining 50,460,000 $USDC were swapped for $WAVAX on JoeSwap and it changed the reserve of the pool   5. The attackers contract called the updateExchangeRate function on the CauldronV2 smart contract, which changed the ExchangeRate variable according to the previous JoeSwap pool's reserve amount   6. The attackers contract deposited 0.0045 JoeLPToken to the CauldronV2 and 998,000 $nxUSD were withdrawn from DegenBox. Because of the manipulated ExchangeRate variable, the attacker was able to take that amount for 500,000 $USD worth JoeLPTokens   7.

The update is based on all strategies' balances.The update was triggered in the process of a flash loan and the tokens borrowed from the Bank contract were not returned yet, the low balance led to a low multiplier.The attacker returned the flash loan and finished the preparation transaction.In the next transaction, the attacker deposited tokens with the low multiplier, updated the multiplier to a higher (normal) value, and withdrew the tokens with the high multiplier.Because the multiplier is one of the factors deciding the RhoToken balance, the attacker's RhoToken balance was increased in the transaction so they were able to withdraw more tokens than they deserve from the Vault.The attacker repeated this process multiple times.Stolen funds were transferred to this address and then redistributed between several external addresses:https://bscscan.com/address/0xb7a740d67c78bbb81741ea588db99fbb1c22dfb7#tokentxns",,FLURRY,2022-02-23,293000.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",['Binance'],2.0,2.0,54.0

In other words, it was a conventional spam attack in which the attacker allegedly issued a large number of price requests, causing node operators to suddenly pay exorbitant amounts for Ethereum's gas costs.Hot wallets are kept by node operators to offset any gas expenses (to ensure their services work). In this example, the wallets' reserve funds were quickly depleted, with one operator reporting losing 20 ETH.The attacker minted new Chi tokens (which provides a hedge against gas price volatility and users can mint new tokens at current prices, and trade them later, depending on whether the price is higher or lower than when the token contract was created) at the higher price, then sold them for regular ETH.",,,2020-09-05,245000.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",['Ethereum'],9.0,5.0,249.0

Looking at the transaction details, the slippage control values correctly reflected the 1% tolerance, but the LP value still did not conform.The problem: a Miner Extractable Value (MEV) bot inspected the transaction, bundled the transactions such that the bot could make financial profits, and sent these transactions privately to a particular group of miners who then mined these transactions.The Uniswap V2 Router contract has implicit assumptions that are not clearly stated on the contract level. Hence, without stating these assumptions, slippage control for some trades on Uniswap V2 may not be checked and may not be taken into account at all in certain scenarios.These implicit assumptions on Uniswap V2 resulted in 20 addresses on Alpha Homora V2 being impacted and lost a total of 40.93 ETH to miners who extracted this value.The list of affected addresses: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 affected addresses were compensated.",,ALPHA,2021-10-23,170704.0,170704.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",['Ethereum'],10.0,5.0,296.0

This leads to a typical pattern of token attacks: if the balance of a Uniswap pair can be reduced without any swap (i.e. the difference between the recorded reserves and the actual token balances), there is a possibility of price manipulation.3) The attack is carried out by switching from a pair of WBNB-Hackerdao to a pair of BSCUSD-Hackerdao, which leads to an unbalanced price.",,Hackerdao,2022-05-24,65155.0,0.0,"{'id': 15, 'type': 'Flash Loan Attack'}",['Binance'],5.0,1.0,144.0

One of these was Alberto Armandi, who was related to Bitscalper, a scam earlier that year. Alberto Armandi reportedly hacked into the website he himself helped code. The vulnerability was in the withdrawal script that Alberto coded, reportedly intentionally as a backdoor. Although incredible, Armandi has also released a story denying he hacked the website.

Each transaction involved the following steps: 1. Taking a flash loan of 40 WBNB;2. Exchanging the borrowed amount to HEALTH;3. Calling 999 token transfers with 0 value. Due to the bug in _transfer(), the number of HEALTH in the pool decreased each time, hence the token price was increasing.4. Exchanging the inflated HEALTH token to WBNB with profit. 5.

944,Iron Finance (2),"On the 16th of April, TITAN reached an all-time high of $64 and some investors cashed out. As a result, the price dropped to $60, where it remained for a time.However, when TITAN fell below $60, it prompted a fresh wave of selling by big investors, commonly known as whales, driving the price down below $30. Because of the decline in the TITAN price, the IRON stablecoin lost its peg and fell to $0.90. This is where the real issues started.The price oracle, which is a smart contract that generates token prices from liquidity pools, could not keep up with the volatility since it utilizes a 10 minute Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) to determine the CR. Users could purchase IRON tokens for $0.90 and instantly redeem them for $0.75 USDC and $0.25 TITAN, which they could then sell for a risk-free profit.Investors were ready to purchase dips in IRON and TITAN, helping IRON to briefly reclaim its peg and driving the TITAN price back up to $50.This triggered another wave of selling as additional major traders began to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity, flooding the market with newly minted TITAN and finally dumping it as the price approached zero. As a result, IRON fell further, reaching a low of $0.58 before rebounding to $0.74 at the time of writing.The TITAN supply that was supposed to be capped at 1 billion tokens expanded without limit.",,TITAN,2021-06-16,0.0,0.0,"{'id': 19, 'type': 'Other'}",['Polygon'],6.0,2.0,167.0
